# Taxi Fare Prediction

This project involves building a predictive model to estimate taxi fares based on various features such as pickup and dropoff locations, date, time, and number of passengers. The project involves several steps, including data cleaning, feature extraction, outlier removal, and distance calculation using the Haversine formula.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to predict the taxi fare based on a variety of features using a structured machine learning workflow. We focus on data preparation, cleaning, and feature engineering before feeding the data into the machine learning model for prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 50,000 taxi rides, each with attributes including:
- Fare amount
- Pickup and dropoff longitude and latitude
- Date and time of pickup
- Number of passengers

## Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values: No missing values were found in the dataset.
- Data type conversion: Converted date and time columns to datetime objects for easy manipulation.
- Outlier detection: Applied outlier removal techniques to clean the data for better model performance.

## Feature Engineering

- Time-based features: Extracted features like hour, minute, date, day of the week, month, and year from the pickup date and time.
- Distance calculation: Used the Haversine formula to compute the distance between pickup and dropoff locations based on their longitude and latitude.

## Model Building

The model-building phase includes:
- Implementing outlier detection and removal
- Feature scaling and selection
- Training and testing on the processed dataset

## Evaluation

The evaluation metrics and results for the taxi fare prediction model will be provided after running different algorithms.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for cleaning, feature engineering, and predicting taxi fares. The final model aims to provide accurate predictions by leveraging various features extracted from the dataset.
